# Portfolio
A portfolio exercise from the Odin Project.
A 16x16 grid is provided initially, with the possibility to edit the number of rows and columns up to 64.
A hover effect is added to the cells changing the color to random and increasing the darkness by 10% until fully dark. The darkness is restarted after the 10th hovered cell.<br>
